Right now I am in my third year student at the Faculty of Automatic Control and Computer Science, Politehnica University of Bucharest.
Here I study engineering, automatic control and systems science, but also computer science.
In my university years I discovered my passion for computers and programming.
Now I am totally inlove with technology.

Besides the education that I received at the university, I learned a lot in my previous internships.
I had an internship at Electronic Arts, where I was a games producer, in charge with understanding how a game is developed.
The second internship I had it was at Banca Comerciala Romana, where I was a software developer. There I learned how it is to work on a real project as a developer.

My goals are to finish my studies and go for a masters degree as well. But I also think that working will help me learn a lot, so working is another goal for me.
