I think from time to time about the day I will graduate from university. If it were to held a speech at the graduation I would thank google,
wikipedia, youtube and stackoverflow for making me come this far. Everything you need to know you can find it there.

But there are also a few resources that helped me a lot in my development.

1.codecademy

https://www.codecademy.com/

codecademy is the place where you can pick up many programming languages. It is very user friendly and it helped me learn the basics for:
HTML, CSS, javascript, mysql.

2.tutorialspoint

https://www.tutorialspoint.com/

tutorialspoint is the page where I learned a lot about OOP, data strcutes, design patterns and many more.

3. Structures or Why Things Don't Fall

As an engineer I like to understand how the life around me works. I lke to read from time to time from this book.
It has interesting information about how to build anything and it is a nice lecture.

P.S. It is one of Elon Musk's favorite book.

4.iversity

https://iversity.org/

Iversity is a place where you can enroll yourself to many different and interesting courses. It is free which is a big plus.
One of my teachers presented me this website. From here I learned simulink.
